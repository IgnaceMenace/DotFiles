# Arch config file to make the installation of my favorite distro as I like it to be
## config.json
This file is supposed to be used with the archinstall script provided in the Arch ISO
Run it with python -m archinstall config.json

## KDE config
This file (absent 4 the moment) will be a KDE desktop fully configured and stored as a binary file
This is done with Konsave (pip package)
