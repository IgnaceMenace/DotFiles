# Dotfiles
Just a repository with all my linux dotfiles to help me reconfigure each time I reinstall a linux distro.
Take whatever you want, it's free.

## .knsv
This is a file with my KDE configuration saved with Konsave. This software can be installed via pip and will let you store your own configuration or apply any KNSV file you have.

To see what the kde loks like you can check the screenshot provided in the repository.
