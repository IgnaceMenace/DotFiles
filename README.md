# Dotfiles
Just a repo with all my linux dotfiles to help me reconfigure each time I reinstall a linux distro.
Take whatever you want, it's free.

## .knsv
This is a file with my KDE configuration saved with Konsave. This software can be installed via pip and will let you store your own configuration or apply any KNSV file you have.
